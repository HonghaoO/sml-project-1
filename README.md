**Research Goal:** Come up with test predictions for a machine-generated detection problem given a training set and test
input instances

Following is the main function of notebooks:

'Classify dataset domain.ipynb': check if the first 600 data comes from domain 1 and the last 400 data comes from domain 2.

'word embedding preprocess.ipynb':embed the data for neural network model.

'Deep Learning.ipynb':implement Neural network model on domain 1 and predict the first 600 test data.

'test set2 use simple models.ipynb':implement simple machine learning model on domain 2 and predict the remaining 400 data.




To come up with the final prediction result, run the notebooks above, then concatenate the 'out.csv' and 'last 400 out.csv'.
